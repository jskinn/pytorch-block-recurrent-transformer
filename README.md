# Block-Recurrent Transformer

A pytorch implementation of a Block-Recurrent Transformer, as described in

Hutchins, D., Schlag, I., Wu, Y., Dyer, E., & Neyshabur, B. (2022).
Block-recurrent transformers. arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.07852.

Based on the official JAX implementation at [https://github.com/google-research/meliad](https://github.com/google-research/meliad),
however only the recurrent transformer parts are re-implemented.
